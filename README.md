This is a repository for the StARs team, a branch of VI + V Studios. We are working on AR experiences for Stumble &amp; Relish.

The AR experience will be a lens for the client's business card that uses marker tracking technology. The target platform is Facebook and Instagram. We are using Snapchat's development environment, Lens Studio, to create the experience because it allows asynchronous collaboration with GitHub.

The lens will use a mixture of 2D and 3D elements to cultivate a memorable experience for customers at the Stumble &amp; Relish store.
